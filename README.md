# Q3Test Addon Archive

The goal of this project is to archive **all versions** of **all addons** for the **Q3Test**.

Before the Quake III Arena Demo was released, and before the retail CD was available, id Software released test versions of Quake3 called Q3Test. The versions spanned from v1.02 to v1.09 From April to November 1999. During this time many third-party mods and hacks were developed, e.g. to add bots, play additional maps, etc. This project archives those addons.
